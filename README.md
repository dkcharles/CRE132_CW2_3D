# CRE132_CW2

This project is large! This is due to several large Unity packages and demo files being included. The Unity files are in **CRE132_CW2_3DWorld**. There are some other folders for notes and screens shot as this project is the base for your coursework submission. 

I have preloaded useful packages:

- The new Input System and samples. [How to use NEW Input System Package! (Unity Tutorial -  Keyboard, Mouse, Touch, Gamepad)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjee_e4fICc)
- Probuilder.
- Polybrush. Seems to have gone out of fashion a bit but still potentially powerful [Polybrush Intro and Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQyntL-Z5bM)
- AI Navigation (Nav Mesh pathfinding). An overview here: [Unity NavMesh Tutorial - Basics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHV1ymlw-P8)
- Cinemachine. 
- The Terrain tool and samples including a URP 3D world. Terrain demo here: https://youtu.be/nCDGjLRecrs?t=39 
- A decent 3D Character Controller. Code explained here: [1ST AND 3RD PERSON CONTROLLER - COMPLETE COURSE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muAzcpAg3lg)
- An example Game Manager script (similar to ones seen before).
- My Audio system script - making it easy to play sounds/music.
